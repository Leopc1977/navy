## How to Play

This game is designed for two players, each in a separate terminal.

Player 1:

make play

This runs:

./navy pos1

It will display your PID â€” share it with Player 2.

Player 2:

make join PID=12345

This runs:

./navy 12345 pos2

Replace 12345 with the actual PID shown by Player 1.

## Game Logic

- Players alternate turns entering coordinates (e.g. C4)
- Signals are sent to indicate shots
- Maps update with hits (x) and misses (o)
- First to sink all enemy ships wins

---

## Dependencies

- Standard C (no external libs)
- Works on Linux / macOS (POSIX signals)
